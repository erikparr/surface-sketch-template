# Layers System Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Task Execution Error in Test File
**Problem**: "Out of context return of value" error when using `.wait` outside of a Routine/Task
**Solution**: Wrapped all test functions that use `.wait` in `fork { }` blocks

### 2. Missing Velocity Data for Imported Melodies  
**Problem**: Imported JSON melodies have velocities but playback was ignoring them
**Solution**: Added velocity extraction from melody data when `~processNote` is not available:
- Checks if melody has velocity data
- Converts from 0-1 range to 0-127 MIDI range
- Falls back to default velocity of 100

### 3. Missing Melody References
**Problem**: Test file references melodies that might not exist (`\melody1`, `\melody2`, `\melody3`)
**Solution**: Added validation in `~setLayerMelody` to handle missing melodies gracefully

## How to Test

1. Load layers system:
```supercollider
(thisProcess.nowExecutingPath.dirname +/+ "layers/load-layers.scd").load;
```

2. Load melody from JSON file:
- Use GUI "Load File" button
- Select `data/melody-export.json`

3. Start playback:
- Click "Start All Layers" button
- Should play with correct velocities and timing

## Notes
- JSON velocities are stored as floats (0-1) and converted to MIDI (0-127)
- The system now properly handles imported melodies with custom timing
- Warning messages will appear for missing melodies but won't crash the system
